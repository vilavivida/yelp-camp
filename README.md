# Yelp-Camp
*Yelp-Camp is my first full-stack project that was built over Colt Steele's web dev course on udemy. On this platform, users can create, read, update and delete information about campgrounds; users can also rate and review campgrounds edited by others.
<br>The application was mainly created using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap 5.* <br>

**See the application in action deployed on [Heroku](https://peaceful-oasis-73868.herokuapp.com/).
